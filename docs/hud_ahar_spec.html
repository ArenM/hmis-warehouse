An abstract element or complex type cannot used to validate an element instance.

Then, collapse contiguous sequences of space characters into single space character, and remove leading and trailing space characters.</p>
      <p><span class="glossaryTerm"><a name="term_ElemBlock" id="term_ElemBlock">Disallowed Substitutions</a> </span>(Applies to element declarations). If <em>substitution</em> is specified, then <a title="Look up 'substitution group' in glossary" href="#term_SubGroup">substitution group</a> members cannot be used in place of the given element declaration to validate element instances. If <em>derivation methods</em>, e.g. extension, restriction, are specified, then the given element declaration will not validate element instances that have types derived from the element declaration's type using the specified derivation methods. Normally, element instances can override their declaration's type by specifying an <code>xsi:type</code> attribute.</p>

      <p><span class="glossaryTerm"><a name="term_Nillable" id="term_Nillable">Nillable</a> </span>(Applies to element declarations). If an element declaration is nillable, instances can use the <code>xsi:nil</code> attribute. The <code>xsi:nil</code> attribute is the boolean attribute, <em>nil</em>, from the <em>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance</em> namespace. If an element instance has an <code>xsi:nil</code> attribute set to true, it can be left empty, even though its element declaration may have required content.</p>
